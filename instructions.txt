Implement code that executes AJAX request to API. The API returns information about the currency exchange rates. The code should fill up a table with the exchange rates if the response is valid, otherwise it should display an error message.

Instructions:
1. write your code below the "SOLUTIONS" section in the main.js file. DO NOT edit any of the other files.
2. there are 2 pre-defined variables in main.js:
	- endpointURL - URL of the API which would be used for the request;
	- testExchangeRates - example result object that is returned by the API. It can be used to create the logic for the filling of the table or just for reference.
3. You can find info for the API here: https://exchangeratesapi.io/.
4. go through the index.html file. In the upper part of it, there is a form that you should use for the request and on the bottom part, there is a container "results" (it will be used for filling up the result data) and an "error-message" block.

Additional requirements:
1. Show an error message "Please choose a currency first!" if the form is submitted but there is no currency selected.
2. If the form is submitted and there is selected currency but no checkboxes are selected you should send request with URL that looks like this: "GET https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=USD" (the value for "base" key is the selected currency).
3. If the form is submitted and there is selected currency and selected checkboxes you should send request with URL that looks like this: "https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=USD&symbols=USD,GBP" (the value for "symbols" key contains the selected checkbox values).
4. Display the table with filled up currencies and rates taken from the response on successful request.
5. Display an error message if the request has failed.
